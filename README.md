# BINGO With Trivia

Play against two computers to see who gets BINGO! first. During the game, you may be asked to answer a trivia question before you're able to mark your tile(s); if you get the answer right, you get to mark your tile, but if you get the answer wrong, your turn is skipped and that tile is removed from the game. Get too many questions wrong and you won't be able to score BINGO!

# How To Play

Start off by entering your name and then choosing if you want to enable auto-marking or not. If you enable auto-marking, you will not have to manually mark your tiles when they match the winning number drawn. Once you're ready, click on the "Generate Cards" button to randomly generate cards for you and your two computer opponents. Then, click on the "Draw A Number" button to draw the first winning number to start. The computer's tiles will always automatically mark themselves, but the player's card will have to be marked manually if auto-marking wasn't enabled at the beginning of the game. Throughout the game, your opponents may "miss" when they try to mark their tiles, which may give you an advantage as long as you don't get too many trivia questions wrong. 

# How To Win

Just like with traditional bingo, you can win by marking all the tiles in a row, column, or diagonal line, or by marking all four corners (plus the free spot). If the game ends and you didn't win, just click on "Reset Game" and play again.
