# BINGO with Trivia

*Description*
Play against two computers to see who gets BINGO! first. During the game, you may be asked to answer a trivia question before you're able to mark your tile(s); if you get the answer right, you get to mark your tile, but if you get the answer wrong, your turn is skipped and that tile is removed from the game. Get too many questions wrong and you won't be able to score BINGO!
